# Tech-Blog

## Description

The purpose of this blog was to create a website that could be used as a tech-blog for people to talk about their favorite coding facts, or just code in general! Sign-up today and get start interacting with other coders! The users can create posts, leave comments and much more. If you post something, don't worry, you can change your post or you can just delete it. Hope you enjoy Tech-Blog as much as I do!

If you have any feedback feel free to leave a post on the blog and I will give it a look. This is the first full-stack application I have done on my own (with the guidance of good teachers), so any and all criticisms are appreciated!

## Installation

To use the Tech-Blog, you need to sign-up first and then from your dashboard you can create a post. From there you can update the post, or delete it. If you check out the homepage you will see all posts by every user, where you can start leaving comments.
